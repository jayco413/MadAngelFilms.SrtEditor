Tire tight, lads. This witch is a wily one.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,160
Suffer not a witch to live, says I.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,980
Tell me where my treasure is, witch. Your wicked games end here and now.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,340
You won't get a word from me.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:06,740
Serena, please. If you ever truly loved me, you wouldn't be doing this.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,480
I'm not even doing anything, Roderick. Your treasure is cursed.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,680
Now, Captain, she'll never tell. Make her pay for her defiance!

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:28,020
Last chance, witch.

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,060
I did love you.

21
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,060
Oh.

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,700
Ignore her, lads. It's trickery.

you will never find your treasure and you will never truly die

26
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,540
you will wander this island as a ghost knowing no joy

27
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,380
no love only pain like the pain you caused me i will not

28

or

57
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:33,540
it could be a massive montage cover-up one of those government conspiracy to hide the truth

58
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:41,220
and what truth would that be kip the dip like a giant lake monster swimming around out there

59
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:48,180
looking to feast on our flesh and wear our bodies like halloween costumes and and take our candy you

it's all right it's not what it looks like we're uh looking for contacts

71
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:21,140
It appears you have caught us in an awkward position.

72
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,600
It looks fine from this vantage point.

73
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,420
I simply came to inform you that your guests have arrived.

74
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:36,440
Oh, yes, yes, um, I'm going to handle affairs here, uh, before I meet the landlubbers.

Wow.

This place is amazing.

82
00:08:47,280 --> 00:09:01,200
How much do you think this set him back?

83
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Knowing Preston, a big chunk of his inheritance.

84
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Ahoy there, my deities!

85
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Hey!

86
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
All right.

87
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Hey!

88
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Hey!

93
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Oh, my God!

94
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Y'all are here!

95
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Oh, I didn't think y'all would be here.

96
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Oh, y'all made it.

97
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
What the fuck, man?

98
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Oh, what's going on?

99
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Oh.

100
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280

101
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
All right.

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
How are y'all doing?

103
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Hope your voyage by sea wasn't too choppy.

104
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah, other than Willow, it was great.

105
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Me and Boots, you know.

106
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Well, you know how it is.

107
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,280
If the island was big enough for a landing strip, I could have definitely got you guys

108
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
to pay my check.

109
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
But, uh, speaking of landing strips.

110
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Heh.

111
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:51,280

We're getting shot! That's what I'm trying to say! That's what I'm trying to say!

116
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Oh my god! You're gonna have to tell us all about how you and our little Preston met.

117

Oh, yeah. The seasickness has really hit her.

121
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
What's this about sea legs?

122
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Kip!

123
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280

That was tonight's entertainment, everyone. Give them a round of applause. Thank you.

157
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
YouTube Club.

Come here.

160
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
I got something special for y'all.

161
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Here it is.

162
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,280
The master bedroom for the power couple.

163
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Please, feel free to look around.

164
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Pretty nice if you ignore the very white paint, the popcorn ceilings, and that mermaid on the wall.

165
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Yeah.

166
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
At least the view is amazing.

167
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Is that a good day?

168
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Why, yes it is.

169
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,280
To clean your little bum-bum bag.

170
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Now,

171
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I did use it once.

172
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
What a woman won't do.

173
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Oh, yeah.

174
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280

176
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
I trust

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
that you'll make this room

178
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
go a-rockin'.

179
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
That means sex.

180
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
You bet.

181
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Come here, I'll sass a crack at you tonight.

182
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,280
Get up, get up, get up.

183
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
You know,

184
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,280
I could go for a good boat rockin'.

185
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Wanna board S.S.E.?

186
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Serious right now?

187
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
It was a bad joke.

188
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
But it's been months.

189
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Can't we get past what happened?

190
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Can we just get back to being us?

191
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,280
It's not just something you can get over.

192
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,280
I'll never understand how you could just move on like nothing happened.

193
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,280
I didn't even do anything.

194
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Guess we're gonna need a bigger boat.

195
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:37,280
I'll give you a fair warning before we bully way.

196
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Blow the man down.

197
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Blow the man down, bullies.

198
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Blow the man down.

199
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Blow him right back to Liverpool town.

200
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Give me some time to do this.

201
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Blow the man down.

202
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Oh, don't be scared.

203
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Who are you?

204
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Are you with the group that came here?

205
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,280
You should have heeded my warning and left the island while there's still time.

206
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:16,280
When the full moon rises, it'll bring all the wicked things.

207
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Oh, I'm well aware.

208
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
For you see,

209
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
I am one of them.

210
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
One of the wicked things.

211
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
You crazy bitch.

212
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Hey, can't you know?

213
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Let this offering to the great gods of the deep

214
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,280
allow that which was dead to roam

215
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,280
and reclaim what's left to us.

216
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Come in, Nicole.

217
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Just now.

218
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Now, Rebulon.

219
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Soon the blood moon will rise in the dark sky.

220
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,280
And he shall rise from the sea.

221
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,280
From the sea.

222
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Come on.

223
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,280
With lots of pineapples, you know that kind of vibe.

224
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,280
That sounds beautiful.

225
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
But I have a question.

226
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Have you thought anything about your dress yet?

227
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Yes, I found the perfect dress.

228
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Thanks for joining the party.

229
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Hey, guys.

230
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
What's wrong, Willow?

231
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Nothing.

232
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
So seasick, I guess.

233
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Yeah, okay, Willow, you can stop fucking around.

234
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
We've all known you long enough to know that something is not right.

235
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Yeah, come on, tell us.

236
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Okay, fine.

237
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
But it's not like that.

238
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
What is it like?

239
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Whoa.

240
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Easy, big fella.

241
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

243
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
All right, all right, all right.

244
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
You know what? I've seen enough.

245
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
All right.

246
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Hey.

247
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Hey.

248
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Hey.

249
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Relax.

250
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Guys.

251
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Let me go.

252
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
All right.

253
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
Hold on.

254
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Really?

255
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Not until you tell us what's got your panties in a bunch.

256
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
I'll never talk.

257
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Ethan and I are going through a bit of a rough patch.

258
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
It's been getting worse the past couple months.

259
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Well, I mean, that could only mean one thing, right?

260
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,280
That he cheated on you?

261
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I knew he was a cheater.

262
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
No, no, you didn't cheat.

263
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
I did.

264
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Oh, Willow, I did not ever expect to hear those words leave your mouth.

265
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I didn't mean it.

266
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
I was in a weird headspace.

267
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
I was stressed at work.

268
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,280
They were expecting so much out of me.

269
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Crazy hours, busier workload.

270
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,280
I've met someone who offered to help me.

271
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Why wasn't I enough?

272
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I mean, I did everything right, and she's still straight.

273
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Listen, it's not your fault.

274
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
You did nothing wrong.

275
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
I can't fucking believe it.

276
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Who was it?

277
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Some giant douchebag from our work.

278
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Ugh, it's always those giant douchebags from work.

279
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,280
They don't operate like we do.

280
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Like real men.

281
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,280
So what did you do when she finally told you?

282
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,280
I forgave her right away.

283
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Oh my god.

284
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,280
He forgave you right away?

285
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,280
That's gross and reeks of desperation.

286
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Well, I don't know.

287
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Maybe he just loves her.

288
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
I don't know.

289
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,280
I honestly was with someone that was okay with me stepping out, and he gave me the ick.

290
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Well, did he give you the ick?

291
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Yeah.

292
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
That's the thing, though.

293
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Mr. Liberty forgave me right away, but at the same time, I wanted him to fight for me.

294
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Yeah, that sounds weird.

295
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
No, it doesn't.

296
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Because you are a queen, and he should fight for you.

297
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,280
I don't know if you guys, like, understand what's going on here, though.

298
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:54,280
The more time passes, the more distant I feel myself growing from him.

299
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,280
So, what are you going to do?

300
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
I love him.

301
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm not in love.

302
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I guess I'm just ready to move on.

303
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
So what's the plan?

304
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Plan?

305
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Simple.

306
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,280
I'm going to remind Willow of the guy she fell in love with.

307
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Yeah.

308
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I'm not going to let this little speed bump stop us.

309
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm going to win her back, or I'm going to die trying.

310
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Hell yeah!

311
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Heck yeah!

312
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Yeah.

313
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Yeah.

314
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
I just felt a breakthrough, y'all.

315
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
I just felt a breakthrough.

316
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
And you know what it calls for?

317
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,280
One big heterosexual male group hug!

318
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Bring it in, guys.

319
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Bring it in.

320
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Bring it in.

321
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Bring it in.

322
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
What the fuck?

323
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
I don't know.

324
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
What is this?

325
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Some sort of homoerotic show of affection and bonding?

326
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Yeah.

327
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Come here, you pothead.

328
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Am I not getting my notifications?

329
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
What the fuck, you guys?

330
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Get in here.

331
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
What are we crying about?

332
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Here you go.

333
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Thank you.

334
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:24,760
My name is

335
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,280
It's such a shame really.

336
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Yeah.

337
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
I always thought what they had was perfect.

338
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Yeah, I kind of thought they'd be together forever.

339
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
I hope they work it out though.

340
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
No, no.

341
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
I used to think that was what I wanted in a relationship, but now I am not so sure.

342
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,280
What the fuck?

343
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:48,940

2

367
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,180
3

368
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,800
3

369
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,500
3

370
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,280
3

371
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,260
3

372
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,080
3

373
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,280
3

374
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,500
3

375
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:23,760
2

376
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:23,980
3

377
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,000
3

378
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,020
3

379
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,140
3

380
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,200
three

381
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,280
3

382
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,340
3

383
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,700
code took us to. He was some pirate captain that had his treasure stolen from him, and

384
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,300
some witch put a curse on him. It happened on this very island. In fact,

385
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:43,980
you all now sit precisely where Cross met his demise. But his soul remains trapped here,

386
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:51,980
doomed to forever roam until he is reunited with his stolen gold. This gold.

387
00:22:51,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Come on, just sit there. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

388
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,980
Oh my god. Is this real?

389
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,980
One hundred percent. From the treasure of Captain Roderick Cross.

390
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,980
No way.

391
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Yes way.

392
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,980
How is that possible?

393
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,980
Soraya played a very crucial part in helping me find this treasure.

394
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:36,980
And so, the game begins. Under some of your chairs lies three maps.

395
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,980
Now, there's only three maps, so I've divided you guys into three groups. Two couples.

396
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
Two couples.

397
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
And a group of weirdos.

398
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
Oh.

399
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Oh, that's us.

400
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,980
Weird and weirdos.

401
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
Yeah?

402
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,980
You must work together in order to solve the riddles to find the hidden treasure.

403
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,980
Once you find it, it is yours for the taking.

404
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
But that's for...

405
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:11,980
Don't eat it all! No! Stop! No, cracker! Stop it! No!

406
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Sorry about that.

407
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
Where are the weirdos?

408
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,980
That's for tomorrow morning.

409
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
So rest up.

410
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,980
But until then, the night's still young, my friends.

411
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,980
So let's party!

412
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,980
Yeah!

413
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:47,980
You know, winning that money would be an amazing start for a better life.

414
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,980
Yeah. Yeah, it would. But I just hope the money doesn't, like, cause any issues between us, you know?

415
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
What do you mean?

416
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,980
She means that money is the root of all evil, man.

417
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,980
People do anything for some scratch.

418
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,980
Preston probably thinks he's doing right.

419
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,980
He probably thinks he's doing right by us, but I think she's right.

420
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,980
It won't change us for the worse.

421
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,980
We're a team.

422
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,980
One for all.

423
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,980
And all for one!

424
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,980
All right, you lunatics, we're officially in this together, so I'm gonna go get some rest, and you guys should too.

425
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
Night, Rubes.

426
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
Good night, Ruby.

427
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Good night.

428
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:41,980
You know, if money doesn't get in the way, time will.

429
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
What do you mean?

430
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,980
You don't want to go your entire life living with regret.

431
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,980
Just thinking what would've happened if you'd actually gone after true happiness.

432
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,980
You know, Kip, you don't say a whole hell of a lot.

433
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,980
But when you do...

434
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,980
You're so wise and full of insight.

435
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
It's not me.

436
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:17,980
It's those hot fudge sundaes with the double scoops and the hot fudge and the nuts and the...

437
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,980
I don't know, I don't know.

438
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
It's the weed.

439
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
It's the weed.

440
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Well, I'm gonna head inside.

441
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,980
You don't fall asleep out here, okay?

442
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
I am one with the earth.

443
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
It is all my bed.

444
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,980
Okay.

445
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,980
This money could be a life changer.

446
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,980
It could buy our dream wedding, honeymoon, and a house.

447
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,980
I know, babe.

448
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,980
We're gonna have to bring our A-game if we're gonna win this.

449
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
It's not a matter of if.

450
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,980
It's a matter of when we're gonna win.

451
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,980
Now...

452
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,980
Speaking of A-game, are you all stretched out?

453
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,980
Oh, you know it.

454
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Are you ready for me?

455
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Ready, willing, and able.

456
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,980
Get on your hands and knees, maggot.

457
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,980
And turn around.

458
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
Harder!

459
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,980
Who's my naughty little bitch?

460
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Woo!

461
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,980
Yeah!

462
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,980
It's Rach.

463
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,980
Hey, A-game,

464
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
you ready for the trip or what?

465
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,980
Ready to go.

466
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
Ready to go.

467
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,980
Ready for the camera?

468
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,980
Ready for the camera.

469
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,980
Ready to go.

470
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Ready to go.

471
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:14,800
Now you can enjoy the show.

472
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:58,960
We'll see you next time.

473
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
Yes!

474
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
Yes!

475
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
Go.

476
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,980
Reclaim your gold.

477
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,980
And behold what's more.

478
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:18,980
You remind me of someone I found very unpleasant.

479
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,980
Now tell me which, what games are you playing?

480
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
I...

481
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
I...

482
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
I...

483
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,980
I...

484
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
I...

485
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
I...

486
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
I...

487
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
I...

488
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
I...

489
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
Speak or die in the deep.

490
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
I...

491
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,980
I only wish to aid you in your revenge.

492
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Why on this blue world would you want to do that, little raven?

493
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
I don't care.

494
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
I give you a warning.

495
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
Only one.

496
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Cross me and die.

497
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
But you will die.

498
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
I...

499
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,980
I...

500
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
I...

501
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
I...

502
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
I...

503
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
I...

504
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
I...

505
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,980
I...

506
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,980
I...

507
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
I...

508
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,980
I...

509
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,980
I...

510
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
I...

511
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
I...

512
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,980
I...

513
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
I...

514
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
I...

515
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,980
I...

516
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
I...

517
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,980
I...

518
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
I...

519
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,980
I...

520
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,980
I...

521
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
I...

522
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
I...

523
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,980
I...

524
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,980
I...

525
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
I...

526
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,980
I...

527
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
I...

528
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
I...

529
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
I...

530
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
I...

531
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
I...

532
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
I...

533
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,980
I...

534
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
I...

535
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,980
...

536
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,980
I...

537
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,980
I...

538
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,980
I...

539
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,980
I...

540
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,980
I...

541
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
I...

542
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
I...

543
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,460
Winning could put us in a good place to start over.

544
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,440
We could get back to finding who we are.

545
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,900
No, I never forgot who we were.

546
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,720
Being happy doesn't need to take a lot of money.

547
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,620
Just being us is a good start.

548
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,740
I'm not quite ready for bed yet.

549
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,480
I have to take a shower.

550
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,140
You rest.

551
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,620
You have a busy day tomorrow.

552
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:26,960
I'll see you tomorrow.

553
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,320
Please, just get back to me, Willow.

554
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,000
Miss you.

555
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,300
Ethan?

556
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,480
Fuck.

557
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,260
What?

558
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,200
No time.

559
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,880
I've been doing this for a week and a half now,

560
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,380
plus, we're running late,

561
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:10,080
so I'm wound up bunch of Hygraneous

562
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,180
Okay?

563
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,760
I know, I know.

564
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,180
We will, how long?

565
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,200
Like, you know, we should buy furniture,

566
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,260
baby.

567
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,840
Yeah, I think we should.

568
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,580
Oh, we're running late.

569
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,360
I'm so busy.

570
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,820
I wonder how you are.

571
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:56,960
I'll see you next time.

572
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,360
Last night was amazing.

573
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,960
I don't know what got into you.

574
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,560
Oh, like you said.

575
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,060
You got my sights set on a bigger prize.

576
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,380
Ooh, I guess they're good now.

577
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,960
Yeah, I guess there's hope for mankind after all.

578
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,780
Just like we practiced.

579
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,000
We're in this to win this.

580
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,080
Yeah, babe.

581
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,540
We're unstoppable.

582
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,680
They have no drive.

583
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
They have no determination.

584
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,360
They're weak.

585
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,740
We're the 80.

586
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,880
The alphas.

587
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,540
I'm the alpha beta boy.

588
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,620
Avast ye mateys.

589
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,120
Batten down the hutters.

590
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,080
For we have treasure to hunt.

591
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,680
Hold up your doubloons.

592
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,920
Each of you has one.

593
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,520
This is part of the treasure.

594
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,120
The first person to discover the treasure

595
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,900
must add the doubloon to it.

596
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,680
The first people to do so will reap great treasure

597
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,340
that would make Blackbeard himself

598
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,460
tighten in his pants.

599
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,400
Yeah?

600
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Yeah, but are the costumes totally...

601
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
necessary or...

602
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
They're so fun.

603
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
And you look hot.

604
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Oh, yeah.

605
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
When don't I?

606
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Does that mean we can start?

607
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Um...

608
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Oh, yeah.

609
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Let the games...

610
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
BEGIN!

611
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
They seem serious.

612
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Yeah.

613
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
But they're going the wrong way.

614
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
Oh.

615
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Oh.

616
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Oh.

617
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Oh.

618
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Oh.

619
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Oh.

620
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Oh.

621
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Oh.

622
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Oh.

623
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Oh.

624
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
Oh.

625
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Oh.

626
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Oh.

627
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Oh.

628
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Oh.

629
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Oh.

630
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Oh.

631
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Oh.

632
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Oh.

633
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Oh.

634
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Oh.

635
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Oh.

636
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
Oh.

637
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Oh.

638
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
Oh.

639
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Oh.

640
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
Oh.

641
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Oh.

642
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Oh.

643
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Oh.

644
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
Oh.

645
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Oh.

646
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Oh.

647
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
Oh.

648
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Oh.

649
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Oh.

650
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Ah.

651
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Oh.

652
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Oh.

653
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Oh.

654
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Oh.

655
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Oh.

656
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Oh.

657
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Oh.

658
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Oh.

659
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Oh.

660
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
I'm coming aboard.

661
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
And where is mine?

662
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Well?

663
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
In there.

664
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Of course it is.

665
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Finally.

666
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,920
Seven pieces shy.

667
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Where is the rest

668
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
of my Gold Witch?

669
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Speak now.

670
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,920
Or never again.

671
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
There are others

672
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,920
on this island.

673
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
Seven others.

674
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,920
And they each have one piece.

675
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
They're playing a game.

676
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
They must find your treasure

677
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
and put the seven pieces back.

678
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Sit tight, Witch.

679
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
I have some scallywags to find.

680
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
The seven must

681
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
be returned.

682
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Let's go.

683
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Time to play!

684
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Easy there. It's just us.

685
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
It's time to play.

686
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Why are you dressed like that?

687
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,920
Pirate games.

688
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Remember?

689
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
The whole reason we're on this island?

690
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Yeah.

691
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,920
I remember.

692
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
I told you not to pass out here, man.

693
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
I was going to go in,

694
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,920
but that weird

695
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,920
witchy lady came by

696
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
and shotgun weed into my face.

697
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
I just passed out here.

698
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
That's a weird dream,

699
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Sal.

700
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Yeah, with her involved in it,

701
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
they're probably pretty amazing.

702
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,920
No.

703
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
She just showed up

704
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
and started dancing by the water

705
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
and then that dead pirate guy

706
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
came out of the water

707
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
and killed her.

708
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
That's all I remember.

709
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Jesus, man.

710
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Lay off the green

711
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
for a while.

712
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Or just do that.

713
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Well, you ready to go now?

714
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
You good?

715
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Everyone else already started.

716
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Yeah.

717
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,920
Lead the way, dollface.

718
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
Babe.

719
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
I think we're going the wrong way.

720
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
This map

721
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
is just one big puzzle.

722
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,920
After you crashed last night,

723
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
I stayed up all night

724
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
studying it.

725
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
And from what I remember

726
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
of the island as we sailed in,

727
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
I've determined that this

728
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
is where we need to go.

729
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
I fucking love this girl!

730
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
I'm the brains,

731
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
and you, my darling,

732
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
are the muscle.

733
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
That makes me the boss.

734
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
So if you're done questioning me,

735
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
then we've got treasure to find.

736
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Sorry, mistress.

737
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Much better.

738
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Oh.

739
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
This has to be that strange

740
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
rock structure from the map.

741
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
We are

742
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
gonna win, no doubt.

743
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Yeah, well, if we continue

744
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
this way,

745
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
we should lead us right to the bluffs.

746
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Why are we just standing here?

747
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
This is it.

748
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
It has to be in this cave.

749
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,920
There's no one else in sight.

750
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,920
We're really gonna do this.

751
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.

752
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Yo ho ho

753
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
and a bottle of rum.

754
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Who's that?

755
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,920
Another actor, probably.

756
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Preston's really going all out.

757
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Yo ho ho

758
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
and a bottle of rum.

759
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,920
You look amazing.

760
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Your costume's way better than ours.

761
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
I smell some of my

762
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
missing gold.

763
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Let me guess.

764
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
You beguired in the treasure.

765
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
So what do we do?

766
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Give this to you and you take us to it?

767
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
It's all ours, babe!

768
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,920
No!

769
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Yes, witch.

770
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Run.

771
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,920
Fifteen men, stiff and stark.

772
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
Yo ho ho

773
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
and a bottle of rum.

774
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Ten of the men had the

775
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,920
murder mark.

776
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
It was a cut list, like,

777
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,920
for an ounce of lead

778
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
or a gaping hole in a

779
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
battered head.

780
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Yo ho ho

781
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,920
and a bottle of rum.

782
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,920
There they lie,

783
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920
dare my eyes,

784
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
staring up that

785
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,920
paradise.

786
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,920
All souls bound,

787
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,920
just contra wise.

788
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Yo ho ho

789
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
and a bottle of rum.

790
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Why are you doing this?

791
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Gold?

792
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
That's what you want?

793
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,920
We were going to

794
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
give it to you anyway.

795
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
That's a good lass.

796
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
So I give you a choice.

797
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Fast and painless

798
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
or slow and excruciating.

799
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Please.

800
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,920
I gave you the gold.

801
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
Just let me live.

802
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
I'm sorry, lass.

803
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Cold as the sea.

804
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,920
Ah.

805
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Okay.

806
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
Let's see.

807
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,920
According to the map, we need to keep heading west.

808
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
How much further do we have to go?

809
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,920
Uh.

810
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
Easy, buddy.

811
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,920
It's only been half an hour.

812
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,920
This seems a little excessive.

813
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,920
But just think.

814
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
All this money can get you a

815
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,920
lot of weed.

816
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
Oh my gosh.

817
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
A whole lot of weed.

818
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,920
Who needs the weed?

819
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,920
Okay, so you guys are just being silly now.

820
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
The map says we need to go this way.

821
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,920
So let's go that way.

822
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,920
Coming?

823
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,920
I'm going back.

824
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,920
I'll see you guys back at the house.

825
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,920
Bye, boss.

826
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,920
This is beautiful.

827
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,920
You're beautiful.

828
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,920
Why don't we take a moment and

829
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
look at the map.

830
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,920
Okay.

831
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Hey there, Willow.

832
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
I'm not going back anymore.

833
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,920
And I told you I'd respect that

834
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,920
and leave you alone.

835
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
But I couldn't help it.

836
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
I was walking through the woods today

837
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,920
and I found this

838
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
this pinecone.

839
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
And it brought me right back to that wonderful night

840
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
we spent together under the stars.

841
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,920
Me, you, and the pinecone.

842
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,920
I miss you, my little wispy willow.

843
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
I miss you, my little wispy willow.

844
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,920
I miss you, my little wispy willow.

845
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Ready?

846
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
Lead the way.

847
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
Ready?

848
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,920
Fifteen men of them good and true

849
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Yo-ho-ho

850
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
and a bottle of rum

851
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Each of the men

852
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
step with a pew

853
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,920
Yo-ho-ho

854
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,920
and a bottle of rum

855
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
That's awesome.

856
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,920
That's awesome.

857
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
The costume, the

858
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
the vibe.

859
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,920
It's a very Treasure Island

860
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,920
and I dig it.

861
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,920
Where's my manners?

862
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Come on.

863
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,920
Ah!

864
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Ah!

865
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Are you one of Preston's actor friends?

866
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Did he bring you to this island

867
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
to freak us out and make this all

868
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,920
realistic and shit like?

869
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,920
It's not working.

870
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Don't tell him that.

871
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Do you...

872
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,920
Do you go to college for that shit?

873
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Do you like go, I'm gonna be an actor and go to college

874
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,920
or...

875
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Does that be dumb?

876
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
I saw you last night.

877
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
You were with that goth

878
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
chick, right?

879
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,920
You were with the goth chick.

880
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Is she your girlfriend?

881
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,920
I swear to God, I did not

882
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,920
touch her.

883
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,920
I didn't touch her. I looked a couple times.

884
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,920
I looked a couple times. I mean, I...

885
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
You gotta look sometimes.

886
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
You know what I'm saying?

887
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,920
All I care for

888
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,920
is my gold.

889
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,920
The game? Like...

890
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,920
I dropped out

891
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,920
of the game.

892
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Let's just go back.

893
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Like...

894
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
I'm a little too high for this method

895
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,920
acting bullshit. I mean...

896
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Drop the act. I mean, you just go back to the

897
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,920
house and I gotta be a...

898
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,920

00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,220
don't hurt him I'll do anything you want just don't hurt him

941
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:10,420
anything you say yes willow no just just run away do you love him truly not

942
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:10,900
looking good

943
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,220
I ask again, do you truly love him?

944
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,260
Yes, yes.

945
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,360
Hurry, Willa.

946
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,020
I'm so sorry.

947
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,220
Me too.

948
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,460
Willa.

949
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,060
Would you die for him?

950
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,400
I ask again, would you die for him?

951
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,000
Sorry, lad.

952
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,900
Some wenches aren't worth it.

953
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,980
Willa!

954
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,220
Let this be a lesson I don't need you to trust, boy.

955
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:02,860
Oh, Harlan!

956
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,240
Oh!

957
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,800
Oh, shiver me timbers!

958
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,280
Oh, oh, oh.

959
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,140
Oh, man.

960
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,980
Damn, Grover.

961
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,480
You've been giving me the best rides of my life.

962
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,520
You know, whenever you're ready, we should probably go again.

963
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,800
Again?

964
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

965
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,300
I'll give you the best two minutes of your life.

966
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,100
What if next time we shoot for, like, four minutes?

967
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,200
Four minutes?

968
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:39,240
I mean, yeah.

969
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,400
Four minutes, girl.

970
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,980
Just give me, like, five.

971
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,980
Ten.

972
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,980
Thirty.

973
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,980
An hour.

974
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,980
Give me an hour.

975
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,980
And then when I come back, I'll give you that four minutes.

976
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,980
Maybe if you do that thing with your leg in the end.

977
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,980
No, then that'll be about two and a half.

978
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,980
But don't do the thing with the leg.

979
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,980
I'll be back.

980
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,980
You stay right there looking sexy.

981
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,980
Just like that.

982
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,980
Mwah.

983
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,980
Beautiful.

984
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,980
I've got to be right back.

985
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,980
Oh, boy.

986
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,980
Oh, boy.

987
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,980
Oh, boy.

988
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,980
Oh, boy.

989
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,980
Oh, boy.

990
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,980
Oh, boy.

991
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,980
Oh, boy.

992
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,980
Oh, boy.

993
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,980
Oh, boy.

994
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,980
Oh, boy.

995
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,980
Oh, boy.

996
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,980
Oh, boy.

997
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,980
Oh, boy.

998
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,980
Oh, boy.

999
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,980
Oh, boy.

1000
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,980
Oh, boy.

1001
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,980
Oh, boy.

1002
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,980
Oh, boy.

1003
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,040
Oh, boy.

1004
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,380
Oh, boy.

1005
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,600
Oh, boy.

1006
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,600
Oh, boy.

1007
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,600
Oh, boy.

1008
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,600
Oh, boy.

1009
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
Oh, boy.

1010
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
Oh, boy.

1011
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,580
Oh, boy.

1012
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,140
Oh, boy.

1013
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,520
Oh, boy.

1014
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,100
Oh, boy.

1015
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,660
Oh, boy.

1016
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,380
Oh, boy.

1017
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,880
Oh, boy.

1018
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,300
Oh, boy.

1019
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,760
Oh, boy.

1020
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,000
Oh, boy.

1021
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,580
Oh, boy.

1022
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,660
Oh, boy.

1023
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,980
Oh, boy.

1024
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:46,980
How much farther do you think we have to go?

1025
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,980
Well, one way to find out.

1026
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,980
Should we have left some breadcrumbs or something?

1027
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,980
Where did we get the bread from?

1028
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,980
That makes some sense, Angela.

1029
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,980
Good point.

1030
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,980
Hey! Help! Over here!

1031
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,980
What the?

1032
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,980
Oh, no, no, it's part of the game, so I'm going to have to free her.

1033
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,980
No, this is definitely not a part of the game.

1034
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
Can you please get me out of here?

1035
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,980
Uh...

1036
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,980
Ruby?

1037
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,980
These...

1038
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,980
These are real.

1039
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,980
I think she's really trapped in here.

1040
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,980
How did this happen?

1041
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,980
Long story.

1042
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,980
Well, springy might take a long time, so...

1043
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Night.

1044
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,980
Night.

1045
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,980
It involves an ancient curse.

1046
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,980
A resurrected pirate seeking revenge.

1047
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,980
Basically, the story I told you before is true.

1048
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,980
Cross is here.

1049
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,980
Okay, that was kind of a short story.

1050
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,980
But, um, Angela, any thoughts?

1051
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,980
Because she's talking crazy for sure.

1052
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,980
Um...

1053
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,980
Don't worry.

1054
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,980
This should do the trick.

1055
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,980
This is going to work.

1056
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,980
We'll get you out of here.

1057
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,980
We'll get you some medical attention, okay?

1058
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,980
Thank you both.

1059
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,980
But I do not need medical help.

1060
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,980
Everything I told you is true.

1061
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,980
And not a dead man's chest.

1062
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,980
Who's singing?

1063
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:36,980
It's too late!

1064
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,980
Hide!

1065
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,980
Hide, you.

1066
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,980
...

1067
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,980
Now where did my witchy little rat run off to?

1068
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,980
You'll find us.

1069
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,980
I have to give myself up.

1070
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,980
Fuck.

1071
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:12,760
It's insane. There's three of us and one of him. We could just take him out and escape.

1072
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,540
What part of ghost pirate do you not understand?

1073
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,900
If I go out there, you too can escape. He'll kill you. I can handle myself.

1074
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,160
I think I can get him to spare me. He might need me for something.

1075
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,820
I'll distract him.

1076
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:44,380
There you are, bitch. Scurry off to hide like the rat you are.

1077
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh, no, no, no. I was just playing a game. And you won.

1078
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,720
Another game?

1079
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,380
Can you still appreciate dark beauty?

1080
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,100
I've got to get the fuck out of here.

1081
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:22,540
Now I smell the remnants of my gold. They were here. Where did they go?

1082
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

1083
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,280
Do you know what the term cleave them to the brisket means?

1084
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,780
You slice somebody.

1085
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,280
From the shoulder to...

1086
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,560
To the belly.

1087
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,680
Their insides fall at their feet.

1088
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:49,600
You force them to watch as they slowly and painfully die.

1089
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,640
I know where they're going.

1090
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,020
Leave the way.

1091
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,480
All right, come on. Let's keep going.

1092
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,620
So that wasn't real back there, right?

1093
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,140
Honestly, Angel, I'm not 100% sure myself. So whatever's going on is insane.

1094
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:06,900
What if there are...

1095
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,040
There's a couple and they're just into some freaky deaky stuff.

1096
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,280
Angel, I wish that's what it was, but this is beyond my understanding.

1097
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,460
So we need to get back to the house. We need to figure out what's going on.

1098
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:16,980
Okay, come on.

1099
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,640
Whoo.

1100
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,400
Come on.

1101
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,580
God damn it. These things are so stupid. I told you they get caught on everything.

1102
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,500
I'll help you, Ruby.

1103
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,000
Give me a second. No, Angel, I can do it myself because you're just going to end up...

1104
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,500
Yeah.

1105
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:32,840
There you go.

1106
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,220
Yeah, okay. Guess I'm done with these then. Thank you so much, Angela.

1107
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:36,820
Thank you for your help.

1108
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,320
This rock... Yeah.

1109
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,820
You know what? This is...

1110
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,820
I'm really sorry about you...

1111
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,820
It's fine. I don't even like them anyway.

1112
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,820
Get them off.

1113
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,820
Do you need help?

1114
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,820
No, Angel, no more help. Thank you.

1115
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,320
Okay.

1116
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,820
Ugh.

1117
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,320
Have a mess.

1118
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,820
No!

1119
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,320
Okay.

1120
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:51,820
Okay.

1121
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,320
Okay.

1122
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:52,820
Okay.

1123
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,320
Okay.

1124
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:53,820
Okay.

1125
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,320
Okay.

1126
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:54,820
Okay.

1127
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,320
Okay.

1128
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:55,820
Okay.

1129
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,320
Okay.

1130
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:56,820
Okay.

1131
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,320
Okay.

1132
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:57,820
Okay.

1133
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,320
Okay.

1134
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:58,820
Okay.

1135
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:59,320
Okay.

1136
00:58:59,320 --> 00:58:59,820
Okay.

1137
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,320
Okay.

1138
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:00,820
Okay.

1139
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,320
Okay.

1140
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:01,820
Okay.

1141
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,320
Okay.

1142
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:02,820
Okay.

1143
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,320
Okay.

1144
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:03,820
Okay.

1145
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,320
Okay.

1146
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:04,820
Okay.

1147
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,320
Okay.

1148
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:05,820
Okay.

1149
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,320
Okay.

1150
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:06,820
Okay.

1151
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,120
The sun's starting to set.

1152
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,400
It should be back by now.

1153
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,320
Well.

1154
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,320
Time to prepare the festivities.

1155
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,360
Yeah.

1156
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,680
Get in.

1157
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,420
Wait, wait, wait...

1158
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,720
Tell me you heard that.

1159
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,980
No, they can't have reached us already!

1160
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:27,620
Okay.

1161
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,420
Ah... Let's hide.

1162
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,820
Slowly, slowly.

1163
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:36,640
Ethan!

1164
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,160
What happened to you?

1165
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,080
Is it a snake?

1166
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,540
You won't believe me.

1167
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,820
Oh, I'm sure we will.

1168
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,180
It was attacked by some zombie pirate-looking guy.

1169
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,660
No, no, no.

1170
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,360
We were too.

1171
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,000
That's what happened to us.

1172
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,860
It is impossible, but

1173
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,040
I don't know, it seems like

1174
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,040
the story is true and Captain Roger Cross

1175
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,020
is back or something.

1176
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,360
Where's Willow?

1177
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,200
Is she okay?

1178
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,400
Tried to save her.

1179
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,520
Brett's gone, too.

1180
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,220
I don't think any of us are safe.

1181
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,000
Austin?

1182
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,800
No, I didn't see him.

1183
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,080
But he would have never left Brett.

1184
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,380
He's gone, too.

1185
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,480
Okay, it's okay, buddy.

1186
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,560
We just barely

1187
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,220
escaped ourselves.

1188
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,020
We need to get back

1189
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,220
to the house. We'll be okay at the house.

1190
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,040
Can you move? Can you walk?

1191
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,780
Maybe, maybe, with help.

1192
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,700
Okay, come on.

1193
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,280
You're in my light, baby.

1194
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,600
Preston, seriously.

1195
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:52,780
Preston?

1196
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,780
Preston?

1197
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,780
Preston?

1198
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,520
Preston!

1199
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:14,840
Hey!

1200
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,680
Ethan!

1201
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,320
Hey, Ethan!

1202
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,980
What the hell is going on?

1203
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,580
The ghost pirate guy is back.

1204
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,860
He got Ethan. He attacked us.

1205
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,940
He has your Godmaid and

1206
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,420
Britt and Austin and Willow.

1207
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1208
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,680
Britt, Willow, Austin...

1209
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,400
They're dead.

1210
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,580
Hey, don't even play like this.

1211
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,180
I'm not!

1212
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,740
What are you talking about?

1213
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,400
I just told you, we have to leave.

1214
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,660
How do we get off this island?

1215
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,900
Okay, all right, listen, Preston, I know.

1216
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,340
I need you to focus right now, okay?

1217
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,300
And figure out how we're going to get off the island.

1218
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,900
The ferry, but it doesn't come till tomorrow morning.

1219
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,700
Can we call that?

1220
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,260
No, there's no service here.

1221
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,700
Well, that's just ridiculous.

1222
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:56,400
We're on an island backed up by nothing but generators, okay?

1223
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,980
Do you see any telephone poles or lines anywhere?

1224
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,400
What can we leave?

1225
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,640
There's a satellite phone by the docks.

1226
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,340
Okay, awesome.

1227
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,060
You, me, we're going to the satellite phone.

1228
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,500
You stay here with Ethan.

1229
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:06,900
Got it.

1230
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,220
Okay, lead the way.

1231
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,560
Harley!

1232
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,380
You let her go!

1233
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,520
Another step in my direction, and alas, we'll get a new smile ear to ear.

1234
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,100
Please help me!

1235
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,960
Please help me!

1236
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,860
Hold on, babe.

1237
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,180
Let me take a wild guess.

1238
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,060
You want money, right?

1239
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,600
Just my gold.

1240
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,000
Return it, and this nightmare ends.

1241
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,860
What are you talking about?

1242
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,280
I think he means these.

1243
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,760
Take them and let her go.

1244
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:38,940
No, no.

1245
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,200
We're still alive, are we?

1246
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,620
We end this our way.

1247
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,600
Ah!

1248
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:51,920
Ah!

1249
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,040
Ah!

1250
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,820
Inside the house.

1251
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,700
I can't protect you, I can't hear the noise.

1252
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:01,660
Ah!

1253
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:05,680
Ethan!

1254
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,360
Ah!

1255
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,580
The actual fuck is going on right now.

1256
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:20,900
Harley.

1257
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,320
What are you doing?

1258
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:23,740
Ah!

1259
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,140
Don't follow me!

1260
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:25,540
Rest in peace.

1261
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:25,680
Rest in peace.

1262
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:25,700
Rest in peace.

1263
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:25,740
Rest in peace.

1264
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:25,760
Rest in peace.

1265
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:25,820
Rest in peace.

1266
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:25,840
Rest in peace.

1267
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:25,860
Rest in peace.

1268
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,340
What are you looking for?

1269
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,560
What are you looking for?

1270
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,260
What are you...

1271
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:28,480
Oh, my God.

1272
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,740
If you want to survive, I suggest you move.

1273
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,780
Preston, move.

1274
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,580
Let her work.

1275
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,200
Move!

1276
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,360
What is that?

1277
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,680
We need a barrier.

1278
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,680
This is common rocks, so it won't last long, but it'll buy us some time.

1279
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,440
This will be the last time you interfere with me, witch.

1280
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:06,780
It won't last long.

1281
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:13,420
Even now, the blood moon rises, and this curse will be at its fullest, and I will enter.

1282
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,000
Believe me when I say, no quarter will be given.

1283
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,260
Hmm.

1284
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:19,820
Hmm.

1285
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:23,340
I meant to say, you know my trajectory.

1286
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,440
tar点

1287
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,480
ы

1288
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,760
Can somebody please tell me

1289
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,340
why creepy old pirate dude back there is killing all my friends.

1290
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,720
If you don't mind, perhaps I should appreciate it.

1291
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,860
It started 300 years ago.

1292
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:45,860
It...

1293
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,540
It has to be a program.

1294
01:04:49,540 --> 01:05:18,360
This is a story

1295
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,680
Veiled by the shadows of time

1296
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,740
A story of love, treachery, and of a curse

1297
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:30,600
That has haunted my bloodline for generations

1298
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:35,680
Long ago, on this very island

1299
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,720
My ancestor stood

1300
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:43,220
Her heart entwined with that of Captain Rotary Cross

1301
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:47,600
But their love was eclipsed

1302
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:51,260
By betrayal and greed

1303
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,060
Deep in the archives of my family home

1304
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:57,460
I uncovered a map, a cryptic guide

1305
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:02,500
That led directly to the very gold the cross could never find

1306
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,880
And as I delved further into the folklore

1307
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,160
The story came to life

1308
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,040
In my pursuit, I exhausted all the resources

1309
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,840
Until I met Preston

1310
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,560
Whose wealth became available

1311
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,100
The tool necessary for the expedition

1312
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,320
To find the stolen gold

1313
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,940
Now make no mistake

1314
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,620
This gold is more than mere metal

1315
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,520
It is the tool necessary

1316
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,680
To break the curse

1317
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,940
And end the torment of my family

1318
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,920
To bring cross to corporeal form

1319
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,380
A dark ritual was necessary

1320
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,260
A sacrifice

1321
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,580
The blood of a fish

1322
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:53,600
A fisherman mingled with the gold

1323
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,420
An unholy offering

1324
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,640
To summon cross from the abyss

1325
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,920
And now he exists in a form

1326
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,660
That can reunite with his stolen gold

1327
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,600
And once he has retrieved all the gold

1328
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,700
He will return to human form

1329
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:15,100
At which point I can fulfill my destiny

1330
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,140
To end the curse

1331
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,140
To end him

1332
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,140
And the curse that is haunted by bloodline

1333
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:25,940
Our fates are intertwined

1334
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:30,440
Only together can we face the looming darkness

1335
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,360
So brace yourselves

1336
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,140
For the blood moon approaches

1337
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,900
Yes?

1338
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,900
So, let me get this straight

1339
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,140
Cause my comprehension skills

1340
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,840
Really ain't all that good

1341
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,840
So, from your story

1342
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,840
You tricked me

1343
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,840
Murdered some dude

1344
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,840
Which brought back

1345
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,840
This demon pirate

1346
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,840
Who killed most of my friends

1347
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,840
Who'll probably kill all of us here tonight

1348
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,840
All because you wanted to break some

1349
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,840
Generational curse

1350
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,840
I mean, yes

1351
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,840
But, like I said

1352
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,840
Our destinies are intertwined

1353
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,840
My fate is to break the curse

1354
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,840
And blood had to be spilled

1355
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,840
For the greater good

1356
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,840
Yeah...

1357
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,840
Nah, bitch

1358
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
That ain't it

1359
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
You gotta go

1360
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,840
Come on

1361
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,840
No, what are you doing?

1362
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,840
What?

1363
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,840
You know you need me

1364
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,840
Not that much

1365
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,840
No

1366
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,840
No, no

1367
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,840
No, no, no

1368
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Let me in

1369
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,840
Let me in

1370
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,840
I'm your only chance to survive

1371
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,840
No fucking way

1372
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,840
I like the rest of our friends too

1373
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,840
Yeah, I can still help you

1374
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,840
Listen, your goals

1375
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,840
All of your goals

1376
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,840
It's right inside

1377
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,840
You can get this

1378
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,840
And then

1379
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,840
You get your revenge on them

1380
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,840
The only one I want revenge on is you

1381
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:09,840
No, please

1382
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,840
No

1383
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,840
Let the water cleanse you

1384
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,840
No, please

1385
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,840
I can't

1386
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,840
Fine

1387
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,840
No, let me in

1388
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,840
Yes, you love me

1389
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,840
Never

1390
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,840
Say no

1391
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,840
No, please

1392
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,840
Please

1393
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,840
I'm young

1394
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,840
Let me in

1395
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,840
What do you mean?

1396
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,880
I'm the reason

1397
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,080
I don't understand

1398
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:29,840
Or even know

1399
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,600
What you've done

1400
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:30,840
No

1401
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,840
Bye

1402
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,840
Bye

Peace

bye

1418
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:45,000
well i have an idea

1419
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:57,760
we have to end cross and get off of this damn island from what soraya said once he gets his

1420
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:03,940
gold he's more or less human and killable so we give him his gold and when he's whole we end him

1421
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:05,680
before he can end us

1422
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:22,940
there's three of us and one of him so the math's on our side

1423
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:30,200
okay let's kill us a 300 year old pirate

1424
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:37,400
okay yeah sure no problem it's good yeah that felt good we're fucked yeah

01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:55,180
okay so we count to three open the door

1428
01:11:55,180 --> 01:12:00,020
and give him hell yeah that's the plan

1429
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:05,980

01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,440

01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,320
come on we need to work as a team

1457
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,860
Honestly, it's not working, Ruby.

1458
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,500
Well, what are we supposed to do?

1459
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,980
No, you can get the hell out of here.

1460
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,800
What the fuck are you going to do?

1461
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,400
Hey, hey, I got it.

1462
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,900
I fucking hope so.

1463
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,080
All right.

1464
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,660
It's just me and you.

1465
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:30,620
Mono e mono, you crusty piece of shit.

1466
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,460
You flipped the wrong flapjack, buddy.

1467
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,200
What?

1468
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:41,940
No honor?

1469
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,880
You have no right to die with us, boy.

1470
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,700
All right, it's now or never.

1471
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:00,700
Just follow my lead.

1472
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:01,440
You have the coins?

1473
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,300
Ruby, before we do this,

1474
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,260
there's something I need to tell you.

1475
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,780
Angela, whatever it is, it can wait, okay?

1476
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,620
We need to do this.

1477
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,120
You want these?

1478
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,220
You want to parlay?

1479
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,060
No.

1480
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,260
I know you won't give quarter.

1481
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,880
I just want a fair fight.

1482
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:55,000
After centuries, the curse is broken and I live again.

1483
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:02,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1484
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,320
Ha!

1485
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:06,380
Ha!

1486
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:06,920
Ha!

1487
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:06,980
Ha!

1488
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,000
Ha!

1489
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,020
Ha!

1490
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:07,100
Ha!

1491
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:07,120
Ha!

1492
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,320
No!

1493
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,320
Play you too, Takengan.

1494
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,320
What's your name, lass?

1495
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,320
You must know, it's Ruby.

1496
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,320
Oh, is that funny to you?

1497
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,320
No treasure is complete without a Ruby.

1498
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,320
Help!

1499
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,320
Help!

1500
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,320
No!

1501
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,320
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1502
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,320
Please!

1503
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,320
Please!

1504
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,320
Oh, no, no, no!

1505
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,320
Angelo, no, no, no!

1506
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,320
Oh, God, why did you do that?

1507
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,320
Why?

1508
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,320
Please!

1509
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,320
Okay, alright.

1510
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,320
Yeah, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

1511
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,320
Okay.

1512
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:35,320
I just want to tell you how I feel about you.

1513
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,320
Oh, no.

1514
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,320
Oh, no, Angelo.

1515
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,320
No, Angelo, I always knew, I always knew, you dummy.

1516
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:56,320
Like a ship lost at sea, love is destined to sink to the depths, forsaken and forgotten.

1517
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,320
This ends now.

1518
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,320
Yeah!

1519
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,320
Oh!

1520
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,320
Oh!

1521
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,320
Oh!

1522
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,320
Oh!

1523
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,320
Hey!

1524
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,320
Let's get out of here!

1525
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,320
Ugh!

1526
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,320
Hey!

1527
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,320
Ugh!

1528
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,320
Ugh, argh, argh!

1529
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,320
Fine!

1530
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,320
Fine!

1531
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,320
Fine!

1532
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,320
Fine!

1533
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,320
Ugh!

1534
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,620
Take this!

1535
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,320
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh!

1536
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,320
Meh!

1537
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,320
Eh, ugh!

1538
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:52,540
I'm sorry that you never had true love, but none of that had anything to do with any of us!

1539
01:17:52,540 --> 01:18:00,100
The only thing I love is gold. And lead.

1540
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:06,760
El Davy Jones, we said what's up?

1541
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:14,260
You savvy?

1542
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:22,360
Preston! Oh, God. Oh, you're okay.

1543
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:30,360
Okay. Okay. You're okay? Oh, God. Okay, enough? Okay, okay.

1544
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,360
Angelo's?

1545
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,360
Yeah, yeah. I'm so glad he finally told you.

1546
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,360
He's the worst timing.

1547
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,360
The fucking worst.

1548
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,360
Let's go get a pizza or something.

1549
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,360
The satellite phone worked eventually.

1550
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,360
So, hope's on the way.

1551
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,360
Man, I hate this fucking place.

1552
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,360
Island paradises suck ass.

1553
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,360
Yep.

1554
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,360
That was exactly what I needed.

1555
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:12,360
What did I miss, though? Story time? Tell me everything?

1556
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,360
Hey, did I tell you how much I fucking love this girl?

1557
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,360
Oh, my God. Are you shot?

1558
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,360
That's just a flesh wound.

1559
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,360
Come here, girl.

1560
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

1561
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,360
You know, I do still want a destination wedding, though.

1562
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,360
Let's not do a pirate's beach.

1563
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,360
Maybe do something landlocked at this time.

1564
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,360
Hey, Ruby, what do you say? You want to be my best man, woman, person?

1565
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,360
I just need somebody to keep this chicken check.

1566
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,360
You know what I'm saying?

1567
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,360
I don't know, Preston.

1568
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,360
I think I might be done with your vacations for a while.

1569
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,360
Oh, okay. Fair enough.

1570
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,360
I'm gonna wipe out.

1571
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,360
I'm yours.

1572
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,360
The blood red,

1573
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,360
blood red beach.

1574
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,360
The

1575
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,360
blood red,

1576
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,360
blood red beach.

1577
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,360
Beneath the line

1578
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,360
of the blood red moon

1579
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,360
A interpretation of a swang

1580
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,360
Lay in a gale howling tune

1581
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,360
Walked something

1582
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,360
not dead or alive

1583
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,000
He haunts this place

1584
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,880
His pain still survives

1585
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,740
A curse of the hag

1586
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,500
The love of a witch

1587
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,440
His heart of blaze

1588
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,220
He torments that bitch

1589
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,000
Greed and hate

1590
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,840
Sully the sad

1591
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,640
He's this morning

1592
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,620
The magic of the hagg

1593
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:11,480
He's gonna go back to the blackbeard

1594
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,060
Blood, bloodbath

1595
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,480
Bloodbath

1596
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:32,480
Son of a bitch

1597
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:42,480
Son of a bitch

1598
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:42,880
Damn

1599
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,880
I think you know a guy

1600
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,460
I think you know a guy

1601
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,380
Shares some weeds

1602
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,540
Shares some stories

1603
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:54,460
He haunts my ass out

1604
01:21:54,460 --> 01:22:01,180
Motherfucker

1605
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:03,840
Greed and hate

1606
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,680
Sully the sad

1607
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,420
He's this morning

1608
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,480
The magic of the hagg

1609
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:12,480
He's gonna go back to the blackbeard

1610
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,860
Blood, bloodbath

1611
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,480
Bloodbath

1612
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,480
Bloodbath

1613
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,480
Bloodbath

1614
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:36,380
Bloodbath

1615
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:39,380
Bloodbath

1616
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:42,380
Bloodbath

1617
01:22:46,480 --> 01:23:16,460
Thank you.

1618
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:46,460
Thank you.

1619
01:23:46,480 --> 01:24:16,460
Thank you.

1620
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,480
Thank you.
